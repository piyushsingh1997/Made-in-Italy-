<h1 id="blockchain-for-made-in-italy-literature-review-preliminary-draft"><strong>Blockchain for Made in Italy (Literature review)</strong> - Preliminary draft</h1>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Blockchain functions as a decentralized and distributed data structure that captures transactions within blocks across numerous systems. It's impact on societal interactions and trade has been transformative. This paper assesses blockchain's applications in diverse domains, particularly its role in bolstering the authenticity of "Made in Italy" products. This is crucial due to the detrimental effects of counterfeiting on Italian products global image and revenue. Blockchain emerges as a pivotal tool in ensuring product provenance, particularly within supply chain management, as its immutable data structure safeguards against tampering. Utilizing traceability solutions based on blockchain can effectively address the limitations associated with centralized traceability systems. This paper also delves into various blockchain technologies, discussing their merits, drawbacks and challenges and identifies the most suitable options and role of Web3, Smart contracts, NFTs in "Made in Italy". Moreover, it emphasizes present cases in which certain enterprises have utilized blockchain technology to confirm the origin, excellence, genuineness of products, and facilitate the monitoring of processes in supply chain management. </p>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The phrase "Made in Italy" serves as a label denoting that a product is entirely conceived, produced, and packaged within Italy, particularly in relation to sectors such as design, food, fashion, cuisine, wine, manufacturing, skilled craftsmanship, and engineering. It is well known and highly regarded label that signifies quality and crafstmanship and used to convey that the product has been designed, manufactured and packaged within Italy, showcasing the country's expertise and reputation in various industries  <a href="https://www.100ita.com/page.php?p=aboutus/made_in_italy">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that counterfeit products and unauthorized use of the <em>"Made in Italy"</em> mark are unfortunately common. There are those who see the blockchain as the solution to protect the real "made in Italy" from clones and immitations for sale. As data that is stored on the blockchains are immutable and difficult to delete. Reliability of the data collected on the blockchain makes it's interesting for tracability. For example, in sectors like agri-food production, where there are over 300 products holding quality certifications like <em>DOP (Denominazione di Origine Protetta)</em>, <em>IGP (Indicazione Geografica Protetta)</em>, as well as more than 500 <em>DOC(Denominazione di Origine Controllata)</em>, <em>DOCG(Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita)</em>, <em>IGT(Indicazione Geografica Tipica
)</em> wines. These products contributed a value added of 64 billion euros and export value of 50 billion euros in 2021. However, these figures are overshadowed by the market value of what's known as "Italian Sounding" – the unauthorized usage of names, logos, and images that mimic <em>"Made in Italy"</em> but lack any genuine Italian connection. This shadow market, estimated at over 100 billion euros by Coldiretti and Filiera Italia, demonstrates the profound impact of counterfeiting. Herein lies the importance of blockchain technology. It has the potential to be a pivotal tool in the fight against fraud, offering Italian companies a means to safeguard their diverse portfolio of high-quality products that constitute Italy's rich culinary heritage <a href="https://affidaty.io/blog/en/2023/03/blockchain-made-in-italy-2/">[2]</a>. </p>
<p>This paper explores the rationale behind the adoption of blockchain technology, specifically focusing on its potential benefits for the "Made in Italy" initiative. It delves into the selection of blockchain as a solution and how it can contribute to enhancing the authenticity and traceability of Italian products. The study identifies the most suitable technologies among multiple that can effectively certify the origin of these products, evaluating their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the paper examines real-world instances where businesses have already embraced blockchain to track and ensure the genuineness of their products.</p>
<h3 id="11-what-is-blockchain">1.1 What is Blockchain ?</h3>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong> plays an important role and it can be defined as "an immutable ledger for recording transactions, maintained within a distributed network of mutually untrusted blocks. A blockchain is a list of ordered blocks, where each block stores a variable size list of transactions" <a href="http://docenti.ing.unipi.it/p.perazzo/research/2019%20-%20BRUSCHETTA_%20An%20IoT%20Blockchain-Based%20Framework%20for%20Certifying%20Extra%20Virgin%20Olive%20Oil%20Supply%20Chain.pdf">[3]</a>. A ledger is a computarized record that can store alll the transactions and it is distributed across multiple locations to store the record of the transactions. Somehow, we can say that every distributed ledger represents the kind of Blockchain but vice versa is not true. All blocks are linked according to some semantics.</p>
<p>Successive segments of the blockchain are interlocked using the cryptographic hash of the preceding block's header. These blocks maintain a sequential chain due to this cryptographic linkage. Apart from the essential cryptographic hash, each block's header comprises a timestamp, nonce, and transaction information. The timestamp in a block is acknowledged as legitimate only if it surpasses the network's adjusted time by over two hours and exceeds the median timestamp of the previous eleven blocks. This safeguard thwarts potential adversaries from tampering with the blockchain's integrity <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X23000493">[4]</a>.</p>
<figure>
<p><img alt="Image title" src="Blockchain%20photo.PNG" width="500" />
  </p>
<figcaption>Fig 1 :- General structure of a blockchain, in which blocks connected with each
other through their respective hash codes [4].
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the addition of each new block, the blockchain expands and serves as a comprehensive ledger documenting transaction histories. Through cryptographic methods, the network can authenticate these blocks. Alongside the transaction records, each block incorporates a timestamp, the cryptographic hash of the preceding block (referred to as the "parent" block), and a nonce—a random number that's used to verify the hash. This framework guarantees the integrity of the entire blockchain, including the initial "genesis block." The uniqueness of hash values makes it exceedingly challenging for fraudulent activities to occur, as any alterations to a block would instantaneously alter its corresponding hash value. When a consensus is reached among the majority of network nodes regarding both the legitimacy of transactions within a block and the block itself, it becomes eligible for inclusion in the blockchain <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-017-0467-3">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the consensus mechanism assists parties who lack trust in each other to establish mutual trust.
The performance and energy consumption of a Blockchain are greatly influenced by these consensus mechanisms. Several methods exist to achieve consensus with some
prominent consensus algorithms being:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of Work (PoW): This protocol relies on computational power to attain
distributed consensus. PoW utilizes hash algorithms where network nodes
(PoW-miners) compete to solve complex mathematical problems typically
demanding significant computing resources. Miners are incentivized with
rewards to encourage the addition of new blocks.</li>
<li>Proof of Stake (PoS): PoS is an alternative protocol for achieving distributed
consensus. While the goal remains similar to PoW the approach differs. In
PoS, validators (akin to PoW miners) are chosen in advance based on the
quantity of cryptocurrencies held in the associated Blockchain known as stake.
PoS-mining (staking) involves using owned tokens instead of computational
power. Users with tokens can stake their holdings (temporarily locking the
tokens) to gain the right to validate a block’s transaction in return.</li>
<li>Proof of Capacity (PoC): This is similar to Proof of Work (PoW) but differs
in its reliance on hard disk capacity instead of computational power. This
difference significantly reduces energy consumption compared to PoW. Miners
in PoC store extensive datasets referred to as plots to enhance their chances
of mining a new block. PermaCoin is a notable example of a cryptocurrency
that utilizes PoC. In PoC, the block generation time is around 4 minutes but
it tends to have higher latency.</li>
<li>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): This is a variation of the PoS algorithm
where stakeholders select a node through voting. This chosen node known
as a witness is tasked with adding new blocks and receiving rewards. In
the election process a certain number of witnesses denoted as N are chosen
based on the highest votes from stakeholders ensuring a minimum of 50%
stakeholder agreement for sufficient decentralization. DPoS includes an in-built
mechanism to identify any malicious witnesses. A cryptocurrency like Bitshares
implements DPoS to achieve high throughput and latency. It can process an
impressive 100,000 transactions per second with an average block addition
time of 1.5 seconds. However, the cost of establishing the blockchain network
using DPoS tends to be higher.</li>
<li>Proof of Activity (PoA): This is a consensus algorithm that combines
elements of both PoW and PoS. In this approach miners attempt to solve a
hash function to discover a new block, similar to PoW. However, the new block
solely comprises the miner’s address and a header without any transactions.
The transaction details are subsequently added to this new block. A group
of validators is then chosen to sign the new block based on the header of the
solved block in order to achieve consensus. This process utilizes PoS which
enhances security against various common attacks. However, this mechanism
tends to introduce higher delays in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a blockchain network, a new block is essentially a group of transactions added
by miners using specific blockchain software. The devices running this software
are called nodes with two primary types: full nodes and lightweight nodes. Full
nodes store and verify blockchain data ensuring its accuracy while lightweight nodes
forward information to full nodes due to their limited memory and computing power.
In the network, any node can propose new transactions which miners collect in a pool
before selecting and adding them to a new block. If any transaction within a block is
found to be invalid, the entire block is discarded. The process of generating a block
involves several steps including token dispatch,transaction broadcasting, transaction
selection based on factors like block size and fees solving complex computational
problems through mining and adding a signature using the Proof of Work (PoW)
algorithm. Once a block is added the network ensures that any alterations are
computationally impossible thus maintaining the blockchain’s immutability. Other
miners verify the signature’s authenticity through hash functions and subsequent
blocks added to the chain serve as confirmations for the previous ones restarting the
process. Additionally, the concept of provenance is central to blockchain technology
facilitating the seamless registration of ownership transfers and providing a clear and
transparent lineage of asset ownership. This feature is particularly advantageous in
industries such as supply chain management and art authentication where the origin
and history of a product or asset are critical. Moreover, the automation potential of
blockchain technology is a game-changer with smart contracts and the availability
of data across all nodes simplifying the validation process and enabling automated
workflows. This streamlined automation not only reduces complexities but also
significantly enhances the overall speed and efficiency of transactions positioning
blockchain as a catalyst for transformative technological advancements across various
sectors.</p>
<h3 id="12-types-of-blockchain">1.2 Types of Blockchain</h3>
<ul>
<li>Public Blockchain: A type of blockchain where anyone can join the network,
participate in consensus and read or write transactions. Examples:- Bitcoin
and Ethereum.</li>
<li>Private Blockchain: A blockchain that is restricted to a specific group of
participants who have permission to read, write and validate transactions.
Often used by organizations for internal purposes.</li>
<li>Permissioned Blockchain: Similar to private blockchains these blockchains
restrict participation to approved users but may allow a larger set of participants
than a purely private blockchain.</li>
<li>Permissionless Blockchain: Permissionless Blockchain: A blockchain where
there are no restrictions on who can join the network, participate in consensus
or transact. It is open to anyone and is typically decentralized.</li>
<li>Hybrid Blockchain: Hybrid blockchains combine the features of both public
and private blockchains allowing for the privacy of transactions while enabling
necessary verification through smart contracts. This approach strikes a balance
between data confidentiality and transparency permitting controlled access to
private information within the network. Since it is owned by a private entity
the immutability of transactions is guaranteed. Businesses can establish their
permissioned networks alongside publicly accessible ones offering participants
complete network access with secured identities. The customizable structure
empowers members to manage transaction visibility and regulate authorized
blockchain access fostering more efficient collaboration with their stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public and private blockchains both employ consensus algorithms for transaction
validation and maintain synchronized distributed ledgers. However, they differ
in accessibility. As mentioned, Private blockchains require special permission to
interact with while public blockchains are open for anyone to access and review
transaction history earning them the label "permissionless." Another category is
permissioned or consortium blockchains which combine elements of both private
and public blockchains. Users need permission to participate or access the network
but permissioned blockchains can function as public networks with varying access
levels. In permissioned blockchains, participants are known to the network operator
and transaction histories remain private. This is advantageous for organizations
needing internal transparency while maintaining privacy externally. A fourth type,
the "hybrid blockchain" which blends private and public components and may
incorporate permissioned features. These three main blockchain types share the
same underlying technology but address different needs each with its own advantages
and drawbacks. The primary distinction between public and private blockchains lies
in their accessibility. Private networks are exclusive with a central entity controlling
participation and roles including mining and transactions.
However, this central authority can manipulate, remove or override transactions
compromising censorship resistance—an inherent weakness of private infrastructure.
Prominent private blockchains include Morpheus Network (supply chain and logistics),
Patientory (a medical supply chain app using a private Ethereum implementation)
and R3’s Corda (designed for highly regulated institutions). Private blockchains are
ideal for businesses and organizations seeking restricted access ensuring transaction
records remain private. Transactions in a private blockchain require validation by
network operators or specific implemented protocols.</p>

<h3 id="13-how-ford-uses-blockchain-to-ensure-authenticity-6">1.3 How FORD uses blockchain to ensure authenticity :- <a href="https://www.blockdata.tech/profiles/ford-blockchain">[6]</a>.</h3>
<p>In January 2019, Ford Motor Company launched a blockchain pilot with IBM to ethically source cobalt. They use <strong>Hyperledger Fabric</strong> to demonstrate responsible production, trade, and processing in the supply chain. The goal is to create an open industry-wide network for tracing and validating minerals and materials used in automotive and consumer electronics. By leveraging blockchain technology, they aim to replace traditional third-party audits with a network of validated participants and real-time accessible immutable data. In late January 2020, Ford and IBM further collaborated to use blockchain for tracing cobalt's source to ensure authenticity and quality for electric car batteries. They are using blockchain technology for tracing the source of cobalt, a crucial component in electric car batteries. The main objective was to ensure the authenticity and quality of the cobalt supplies used by Ford. </p>

<h3 id="14-importance-of-blockchain-">1.4 Importance of Blockchain :-</h3>
<p>In this regard, blockchain technology plays an important role to certify the provenance and products that claims to be "Made in Italy". Blockchain plays an important role in combating food fraud, italian sounding and allow italian companies to defend the numerous high quality productions that are made in Italy. Even non-fungiable tokens could also play a crucial role that allows a creation of unique tokens to digial assets like images, videos and music. It represents a programmable ownership of certificates for digital products allowing creators and companies to sell their digital products while maintaining complete control over the rights. Now, blockchain technology plays in important roles in wine industry <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/23/13070">[7]</a>, food industry <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6290/4/4/27">[8]</a> etc. The success of of this technology primarily depends upon transparency, reliability and immuatability. </p>
<p>The worldwide supply chain for everyday products involves a lot of movement
making it very complicated. Unlike the financial system, there’s no central authority
watching over the supply chain. Normally, companies need to keep their own records
of the products they send and receive. This can cause problems even with technology.
Big companies with many locations and products find it hard to keep track of what
they have. They also have to deal with things like products getting lost or wasted,
fake products and not knowing everything about their supply chains. These problems
can lead to breaking trading rules and harming a company’s reputation. To make
things better companies are looking for ways to see where their products are where
they come from and to check if they’re real. Using blockchain in a supply chain
means all the parties can share the same information. Products can be put on the
blockchain as tokens and their movements are added as transactions which everyone
agrees on before it becomes a permanent record. Using an unchangeable record of
products and transactions in a supply chain has many advantages. First, it helps
to follow products in real-time. When combined with tools like location-tracking
devices, keeping an eye on products becomes easier. Second, it proves where products
come from and if they’re real making customers trust the supply chain more. For
instance, products claiming to be made from sustainable sources can prove it to
customers. It also reduces fraud and fake products. Lastly, the clear and open data in
blockchain can make financial operations in the supply chain smoother. Before it was
complicated to track money between companies, banks and creditors. With everyone
agreeing on product availability, location and delivery dates, it’s easier to calculate
risks and agree on payments. This could also lead to more automated transactions
using smart contracts. Companies can choose different types of blockchains for their
supply chains. They don’t always have to use public ones where everyone can see
the information. They can use private blockchains that only certain people can
access. These are often liked by big businesses because they can control who sees
the information. This can help with following rules about money laundering and
other regulations. On the other hand, as discussed public blockchains let anyone
take part but everyone can see what’s happening.</p>

<h2 id="3-how-blockchain-can-help-made-in-italy">3. <em>How Blockchain can help made in Italy ?</em></h2>
<p>Blockchain technology can potentially help the "Made in Italy" initiative in several ways, especially in promoting and protecting the authenticity and quality of Italian products. Having said that, counter piracy and counterfeiting have been the major problem.Counterfeiters employ diverse strategies to carry out their illicit activities. These tactics encompass forging legitimate product labels, which might involve falsifying expiration dates, creating replicas of authentic products, or affixing genuine product tags onto counterfeit items. For example, Counterfeit Italian goods which, according to OECD surveys, fuel a turnover of <strong>32 billion euros</strong> on the world market, of which approximately 30% is made up of the agri-food and textile-clothing sectors <a href="https://www.sardegnaimpresa.eu/it/news/made-italy-progetto-blockchain-contrastare-la-contraffazione-sui-mercati-internazionali">[10]</a>.</p>
<p>According to one of the OECD(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) report, world trade in counterfeit goods (luxury bags, watches, food products, auto parts) has an impact on the Italian economy of about 1-2% of GDP in terms of sales, while trade in counterfeit and pirated goods in the world amounts to 5% of imports into the EU <a href="https://www.oecd.org/gov/illicit-trade/Summary-Brochure-Italy-EN.pdf">[11]</a>.</p>

<h4 id="32-italian-beer-company-uses-blockchain-for-traceability">3.2 Italian beer company uses blockchain for traceability</h4>
<p>irra Peroni, the Italian beer company, has adopted EY Ops Chain Traceability
to tokenise its beer products using non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum
blockchain. An NFT serves as an exclusive, non-interchangeable digital representation of an asset, stored securely on a blockchain ledger. This NFT acts as a
digital certificate authenticating the identity of the asset and is applicable to various
products, including artworks, photos, and now, food items like meat, seafood, and
beer. Utilizing EY’s blockchain-as-a-service platform available at blockchain.ey.com,
Birra Peroni assigns unique NFTs to each batch of its beer, enhancing transparency
and efficiency within the company’s supply chain. The Italian malt supply chain for
Peroni beer production was analyzed to identify crucial data sources. These information assets were subsequently acquired and securely notarized on the Ethereum
blockchain. Some data remained unencrypted, while sensitive commercial information was encrypted to protect confidentiality. This blockchain-backed data, presented
via multimedia storytelling, is now accessible to consumers through a QR Code on
bottle labels. The QR Code links to a personalized landing page, adapting content
based on the scan’s time and location <a href="https://www.birraperoni.it/news-e-media-comunicati-stampa/birra-peroni-e-la-tracciabilita-in-blockchain-del-malto-100-italiano-una-storia-di-open-innovation/">[12]</a>.
We will see NFTs and it’s importance in the upcoming chapter in detail, but
they are essentially unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific item
or piece of content stored on a blockchain. This technology allows for the verification
of the authenticity and ownership of digital assets paving the way for new forms of
digital ownership, trading and Monetization of creative work. NFTs have gained
significant attention in the art world, enabling artists to sell digital art with proof of
ownership and provenance, creating new avenues for creators to monetize their work
directly. Additionally, they have extended beyond art into areas such as collectibles,
virtual real estate and even tokenized representations of real-world assets. This has
generated a new wave of interest and investment in the digital economy reshaping
how we perceive and trade digital content.</p>
<p>Ethereum blockchain plays an important role here which is like a giant,
decentralized, and secure digital ledger or database that anyone can use. Birra Peroni
has leveraged non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain to tokenise
its beer products. These NFTs serve as distinctive and non-interchangeable digital
representations of each beer item, securely recorded on the ethereum blockchain.

<h4 id="44-corda-blockchain">4.4 Corda Blockchain</h4>
<p>Corda is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) designed for financial institutions and other industries. It enables the development of decentralized applications known as CorDapps, which incorporate distributed ledger functionalities into specific systems such as supply chain, healthcare, stock markets, and insurance. Corda's architecture operates on a need-to-know basis, ensuring transaction privacy. When two parties (Party A and Party B) conduct a transaction and it is verified by the Notary, the transaction becomes an immutable record on both parties' separate databases. Only the involved parties have access to this immutable record. In Corda, a <strong>"State"</strong> represents an immutable object that represents a fact known by one or multiple parties at a specific time. It can hold various types of data, such as stock, loans, emails, addresses, etc. <strong>"Transactions"</strong> in Corda refer to the process of updating the ledger. They follow the unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, where transactions can have multiple inputs and outputs. Transactions update the ledger by marking existing states as history. <strong>"Contracts"</strong> are rules written to ensure that transactions are valid. Transactions must be signed by the involved parties' notaries and be contractually valid, establishing a one-to-one relationship between contract-state. <strong>"Flows"</strong> in Corda represent a sequence of steps that guide a party on how to update the ledger. They determine contract validations and state updates. A <strong>"Notary"</strong> is a trusted and neutral party involved in a transaction, responsible for validating it and preventing double spends <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-25942-5_48">[27]</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>-&gt; <strong>Corda has following features</strong>  <a href="https://r3.com/products/corda/#why-choose-corda">[28]</a> :-</p>
<p>Data privacy and security:- Corda operates as a permissioned blockchain, ensuring that data is shared exclusively among the involved parties in a transaction. Its design prioritizes security, and it requires each entity to be associated with a legal entity and granted access permission before joining the network. This approach enhances confidentiality and trust among the participants, making security a top priority in Corda's architecture.</p>
<p>Native interoperability:- Corda establishes the groundwork for seamless native interoperability, enabling users of CorDapps to exchange value between different Corda networks securely, privately, and with complete control.</p>

<h4 id="47-non-fungible-tokensnft">4.7 Non-fungible Tokens(NFT)</h4>
<p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special digital identifier that exists on a blockchain and serves as a proof of ownership and authenticity for a specific digital asset. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be duplicated, exchanged on a one-to-one basis, or divided into smaller units. The ownership of an NFT is securely recorded on the blockchain and can be transferred from one individual to another, enabling buying and selling of NFTs in the market <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">[31]</a>.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Is NFT really a good idea OR possible way to use it to certify the provenance(example)?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, Let's consider <strong>wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</strong>. An NFT could be created for a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. The NFT would store information about the cheese, such as its production location, date of creation, ingredients used, and details about the dairy farm. It would also include the certification and quality standards associated with authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
<p>When a buyer purchases the wheel of cheese, they would also receive the NFT. The NFT would serve as a proof of ownership for the cheese and would enable the buyer to verify its provenance and authenticity. By checking the NFT, the buyer can ensure that the cheese comes from a legitimate producer in Italy and meets the stringent standards required for genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
<p><strong>To check for validity, one don't only have to check for the metadata included in the token, but also of the creator of the token itself</strong>.</p>
<p>In this case, the use of NFTs makes it more challenging for counterfeiters to produce fake Made in Italy products, such as counterfeit Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. If a counterfeiter tried to sell a fake wheel of cheese claiming it to be authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano, they would need to create an NFT for the cheese. However, the NFT would not be valid, as it would not store the correct provenance information, making it evident that the cheese is not genuine.</p>
<p><strong><em>Overall, NFTs have the potential to be a valuable tool for guaranteeing provenance in Made in Italy products. However, NFTs alone do not address all the challenges and complexities associated with supply chain management in the "Made in Italy" context.</em></strong> </p>

<h2 id="5-which-technology-is-acually-the-most-suitable">5. Which technology is acually the most suitable?</h2>
<p>So, we know blockchain-based traceability solutions enhance the value of products and services by enabling trace and track functionalities. Within a blockchain network, participants can monitor an asset's entire journey from its origin to its destination through the recorded information on the blockchain. To capture relevant asset data, such as location and properties, the blockchain relies on existing methods like IoT, RFID, GPS, among others. Once this data is integrated into the blockchain, participants can easily trace the asset's history <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835220305829">[32]</a>.</p>
<p>In commercial operations, businesses aim to safeguard trade privacy by maintaining confidentiality. To achieve this, companies frequently employ <strong>permissioned blockchains</strong> that involve authorized participants only. One of the key benefits of permissioned blockchains is enhanced security and control. By limiting access to known and authorized participants, permissioned blockchains create a trusted network of participants, reducing the risk of malicious activities and unauthorized access. This <strong>controlled environment</strong> ensures that sensitive business data and operations remain <strong>confidential</strong> and protected. <strong><em>Permissioned blockchains can process a higher number of transactions per second compared to public blockchains, thanks to their more streamlined consensus mechanisms and reduced computational overhead(although indeed other factors plays an important role)</em></strong>. This scalability is crucial for enterprise-level applications that require quick and efficient processing of large volumes of data <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8970301">[33]</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Public blockchains are open to everyone, allowing any individual to freely participate in the core activities of the blockchain network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private blockchains, on the other hand, have a restricted entry system, permitting only verified participants to join. Additionally, they are controlled centrally, which means only authorized entities possess the rights to modify or delete records on the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permissioned blockchains strike a balance between public and private variants. They combine characteristics of both types and have gained popularity, especially in enterprise applications. The key advantage lies in their capability to allocate specific permissions to different users on the network, providing greater control and security over the shared data.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-what-is-web3-and-its-role-in-made-in-italy">7. What is Web3 and it's role in "Made in Italy" ?</h2>
<p>Web1, spanning 1990-2004, offered static online content, making users mere consumers. Web2, the current state, introduced interaction and content upload, with Facebook and YouTube as examples. However, this interactivity raised concerns like privacy and polarization. Web3 aims to shift control to users through blockchain-based networks, maintaining Web2 features. Ad-driven models led to data exploitation, while curated feeds fueled polarization and mental health issues. In contrast, decentralized apps (dapps) in Web3 involve user-driven decisions through token-based governance, addressing Web2's problems. Web3, the emerging paradigm, holds the potential to rectify these issues by shifting control from corporations to users, while retaining the interactive features of Web2. This new model, often described as "read/write/own," utilizes blockchain-based networks and cryptocurrency tokens for user governance. Decisions within these networks are made collectively by token holders, fostering transparency and decentralization. By decentralizing decision-making and eliminating the influence of a single entity, Web3 aims to mitigate problems like biased content curation and data harvesting. This could result in a more equitable and user-centric online environment, potentially addressing the challenges that emerged in the Web2 era <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-is-web3/">[47]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="8-conclusion">8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The world of blockchain technology is rapidly evolving and its potential impact on industries and economies is becoming increasingly evident. In this comprehensive thesis, we have explored various aspects of blockchain, its potential to benefit "Made in Italy" products, and its role in ensuring provenance, traceability and process of a product claimed to be "made in Italy" in supply chains.
Through our exploration, we have seen how blockchain can be leveraged to enhance the "Made in Italy" brand, promoting local artisans and products to a global audience. By utilizing blockchain in supply chains, such as the example of coffee, we can guarantee the provenance of products, thereby assuring consumers of their authenticity and quality (ofcourse by considering other challanges). Several blockchain technologies and platforms, including Hyperledger Fabric, EBSI, Corda, and NFTs, offer unique features that can be harnessed to address specific challenges in various industries. Each of these technologies comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and businesses must carefully assess their requirements before adopting any particular solution. In particular, Hyperledger Fabric has emerged as a suitable option for certain use cases, offering robust privacy and permission features, making it an attractive choice for enterprises and consortium-based networks. Meanwhile, initiatives like Food Trust by IBM and Walmart &amp; other exisiting cases where enterprises are already using blockchain to gurantee provenance &amp; it shows the power of blockchain to prevent against counterfeiting attacks and italian sounding.  However, it’s important to note that the choice of blockchain ultimately depends on specific use cases, requirements, and various other factors. We’ve observed how initiatives like IBM’s Food Trust and TrackIT project, FederItaly along with many Italian companies and other luxury brands are already using blockchain to ensure the authenticity and traceability of products highlighting the power of blockchain in combating counterfeiting and protecting their brands and products labeled as "Made in Italy." Another famous examples in shipping are Maersk, a big shipping company made a new system with IBM called TradeLens. It uses blockchain to help them and their partners share data quickly and documents in real-time which makes dealing with shipping papers faster and cheaper. Then
there’s ShipChain back of Ethereum blockchain technology, another system that uses
blockchain. It helps people who send things, people who carry them, and people</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has already demonstrated its potential to revolutionize numerous industries and countries by delivering enhanced efficiency, trust, and authenticity.  However, its widespread adoption requires continued collaboration, research, and overcoming technical and regulatory challenges. With the right vision and strategic implementation, Italy can be at the forefront of blockchain adoption and innovation, solidifying its position as a global leader in quality craftsmanship and products proudly labeled "Made in Italy." </p>
