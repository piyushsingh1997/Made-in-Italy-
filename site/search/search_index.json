Introduction","text":"<p>The phrase \"Made in Italy\" serves as a label denoting that a product is entirely conceived, produced, and packaged within Italy, particularly in relation to sectors such as design, food, fashion, cuisine, wine, manufacturing, skilled craftsmanship, and engineering. It is well known and highly regarded label that signifies quality and crafstmanship and used to convey that the product has been designed, manufactured and packaged within Italy, showcasing the country's expertise and reputation in various industries  [1].</p> <p>It is worth noticing that counterfeit products and unauthorized use of the \"Made in Italy\" mark are unfortunately common. There are those who see the blockchain as the solution to protect the real \"made in Italy\" from clones and immitations for sale. As data that is stored on the blockchains are immutable and difficult to delete. Reliability of the data collected on the blockchain makes it's interesting for tracability. For example, in sectors like agri-food production, where there are over 300 products holding quality certifications like DOP (Denominazione di Origine Protetta), IGP (Indicazione Geografica Protetta), as well as more than 500 DOC(Denominazione di Origine Controllata), DOCG(Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita), IGT(Indicazione Geografica Tipica ) wines. These products contributed a value added of 64 billion euros and export value of 50 billion euros in 2021. However, these figures are overshadowed by the market value of what's known as \"Italian Sounding\" \u2013 the unauthorized usage of names, logos, and images that mimic \"Made in Italy\" but lack any genuine Italian connection. This shadow market, estimated at over 100 billion euros by Coldiretti and Filiera Italia, demonstrates the profound impact of counterfeiting. Herein lies the importance of blockchain technology. It has the potential to be a pivotal tool in the fight against fraud, offering Italian companies a means to safeguard their diverse portfolio of high-quality products that constitute Italy's rich culinary heritage [2]. </p> <p>This paper explores the rationale behind the adoption of blockchain technology, specifically focusing on its potential benefits for the \"Made in Italy\" initiative. It delves into the selection of blockchain as a solution and how it can contribute to enhancing the authenticity and traceability of Italian products. The study identifies the most suitable technologies among multiple that can effectively certify the origin of these products, evaluating their advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, the paper examines real-world instances where businesses have already embraced blockchain to track and ensure the genuineness of their products.</p>"},{"location":"#11-what-is-blockchain","title":"1.1 What is Blockchain ?","text":"<p>Blockchain plays an important role and it can be defined as \"an immutable ledger for recording transactions, maintained within a distributed network of mutually untrusted blocks. A blockchain is a list of ordered blocks, where each block stores a variable size list of transactions\" [3]. A ledger is a computarized record that can store alll the transactions and it is distributed across multiple locations to store the record of the transactions. Somehow, we can say that every distributed ledger represents the kind of Blockchain but vice versa is not true. All blocks are linked according to some semantics.</p> <p>Successive segments of the blockchain are interlocked using the cryptographic hash of the preceding block's header. These blocks maintain a sequential chain due to this cryptographic linkage. Apart from the essential cryptographic hash, each block's header comprises a timestamp, nonce, and transaction information. The timestamp in a block is acknowledged as legitimate only if it surpasses the network's adjusted time by over two hours and exceeds the median timestamp of the previous eleven blocks. This safeguard thwarts potential adversaries from tampering with the blockchain's integrity [4].</p> <p> </p> Fig 1 :- General structure of a blockchain, in which blocks connected with each other through their respective hash codes [4].  <p>With the addition of each new block, the blockchain expands and serves as a comprehensive ledger documenting transaction histories. Through cryptographic methods, the network can authenticate these blocks. Alongside the transaction records, each block incorporates a timestamp, the cryptographic hash of the preceding block (referred to as the \"parent\" block), and a nonce\u2014a random number that's used to verify the hash. This framework guarantees the integrity of the entire blockchain, including the initial \"genesis block.\" The uniqueness of hash values makes it exceedingly challenging for fraudulent activities to occur, as any alterations to a block would instantaneously alter its corresponding hash value. When a consensus is reached among the majority of network nodes regarding both the legitimacy of transactions within a block and the block itself, it becomes eligible for inclusion in the blockchain [5].</p> <p>Additionally, the consensus mechanism assists parties who lack trust in each other to establish mutual trust. The performance and energy consumption of a Blockchain are greatly influenced by these consensus mechanisms. Several methods exist to achieve consensus with some prominent consensus algorithms being:-</p> <ul> <li>Proof of Work (PoW): This protocol relies on computational power to attain distributed consensus. PoW utilizes hash algorithms where network nodes (PoW-miners) compete to solve complex mathematical problems typically demanding significant computing resources. Miners are incentivized with rewards to encourage the addition of new blocks.</li> <li>Proof of Stake (PoS): PoS is an alternative protocol for achieving distributed consensus. While the goal remains similar to PoW the approach differs. In PoS, validators (akin to PoW miners) are chosen in advance based on the quantity of cryptocurrencies held in the associated Blockchain known as stake. PoS-mining (staking) involves using owned tokens instead of computational power. Users with tokens can stake their holdings (temporarily locking the tokens) to gain the right to validate a block\u2019s transaction in return.</li> <li>Proof of Capacity (PoC): This is similar to Proof of Work (PoW) but differs in its reliance on hard disk capacity instead of computational power. This difference significantly reduces energy consumption compared to PoW. Miners in PoC store extensive datasets referred to as plots to enhance their chances of mining a new block. PermaCoin is a notable example of a cryptocurrency that utilizes PoC. In PoC, the block generation time is around 4 minutes but it tends to have higher latency.</li> <li>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS): This is a variation of the PoS algorithm where stakeholders select a node through voting. This chosen node known as a witness is tasked with adding new blocks and receiving rewards. In the election process a certain number of witnesses denoted as N are chosen based on the highest votes from stakeholders ensuring a minimum of 50% stakeholder agreement for sufficient decentralization. DPoS includes an in-built mechanism to identify any malicious witnesses. A cryptocurrency like Bitshares implements DPoS to achieve high throughput and latency. It can process an impressive 100,000 transactions per second with an average block addition time of 1.5 seconds. However, the cost of establishing the blockchain network using DPoS tends to be higher.</li> <li>Proof of Activity (PoA): This is a consensus algorithm that combines elements of both PoW and PoS. In this approach miners attempt to solve a hash function to discover a new block, similar to PoW. However, the new block solely comprises the miner\u2019s address and a header without any transactions. The transaction details are subsequently added to this new block. A group of validators is then chosen to sign the new block based on the header of the solved block in order to achieve consensus. This process utilizes PoS which enhances security against various common attacks. However, this mechanism tends to introduce higher delays in the process.</li> </ul> <p>In a blockchain network, a new block is essentially a group of transactions added by miners using specific blockchain software. The devices running this software are called nodes with two primary types: full nodes and lightweight nodes. Full nodes store and verify blockchain data ensuring its accuracy while lightweight nodes forward information to full nodes due to their limited memory and computing power. In the network, any node can propose new transactions which miners collect in a pool before selecting and adding them to a new block. If any transaction within a block is found to be invalid, the entire block is discarded. The process of generating a block involves several steps including token dispatch,transaction broadcasting, transaction selection based on factors like block size and fees solving complex computational problems through mining and adding a signature using the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm. Once a block is added the network ensures that any alterations are computationally impossible thus maintaining the blockchain\u2019s immutability. Other miners verify the signature\u2019s authenticity through hash functions and subsequent blocks added to the chain serve as confirmations for the previous ones restarting the process. Additionally, the concept of provenance is central to blockchain technology facilitating the seamless registration of ownership transfers and providing a clear and transparent lineage of asset ownership. This feature is particularly advantageous in industries such as supply chain management and art authentication where the origin and history of a product or asset are critical. Moreover, the automation potential of blockchain technology is a game-changer with smart contracts and the availability of data across all nodes simplifying the validation process and enabling automated workflows. This streamlined automation not only reduces complexities but also significantly enhances the overall speed and efficiency of transactions positioning blockchain as a catalyst for transformative technological advancements across various sectors.</p>"},{"location":"#12-types-of-blockchain","title":"1.2 Types of Blockchain","text":"<ul> <li>Public Blockchain: A type of blockchain where anyone can join the network, participate in consensus and read or write transactions. Examples:- Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li> <li>Private Blockchain: A blockchain that is restricted to a specific group of participants who have permission to read, write and validate transactions. Often used by organizations for internal purposes.</li> <li>Permissioned Blockchain: Similar to private blockchains these blockchains restrict participation to approved users but may allow a larger set of participants than a purely private blockchain.</li> <li>Permissionless Blockchain: Permissionless Blockchain: A blockchain where there are no restrictions on who can join the network, participate in consensus or transact. It is open to anyone and is typically decentralized.</li> <li>Hybrid Blockchain: Hybrid blockchains combine the features of both public and private blockchains allowing for the privacy of transactions while enabling necessary verification through smart contracts. This approach strikes a balance between data confidentiality and transparency permitting controlled access to private information within the network. Since it is owned by a private entity the immutability of transactions is guaranteed. Businesses can establish their permissioned networks alongside publicly accessible ones offering participants complete network access with secured identities. The customizable structure empowers members to manage transaction visibility and regulate authorized blockchain access fostering more efficient collaboration with their stakeholders.</li> </ul> <p>Public and private blockchains both employ consensus algorithms for transaction validation and maintain synchronized distributed ledgers. However, they differ in accessibility. As mentioned, Private blockchains require special permission to interact with while public blockchains are open for anyone to access and review transaction history earning them the label \"permissionless.\" Another category is permissioned or consortium blockchains which combine elements of both private and public blockchains. Users need permission to participate or access the network but permissioned blockchains can function as public networks with varying access levels. In permissioned blockchains, participants are known to the network operator and transaction histories remain private. This is advantageous for organizations needing internal transparency while maintaining privacy externally. A fourth type, the \"hybrid blockchain\" which blends private and public components and may incorporate permissioned features. These three main blockchain types share the same underlying technology but address different needs each with its own advantages and drawbacks. The primary distinction between public and private blockchains lies in their accessibility. Private networks are exclusive with a central entity controlling participation and roles including mining and transactions. However, this central authority can manipulate, remove or override transactions compromising censorship resistance\u2014an inherent weakness of private infrastructure. Prominent private blockchains include Morpheus Network (supply chain and logistics), Patientory (a medical supply chain app using a private Ethereum implementation) and R3\u2019s Corda (designed for highly regulated institutions). Private blockchains are ideal for businesses and organizations seeking restricted access ensuring transaction records remain private. Transactions in a private blockchain require validation by network operators or specific implemented protocols.</p>"},{"location":"#13-how-ford-uses-blockchain-to-ensure-authenticity-6","title":"1.3 How FORD uses blockchain to ensure authenticity :- [6].","text":"<p>In January 2019, Ford Motor Company launched a blockchain pilot with IBM to ethically source cobalt.

Blockchain plays an important role in combating food fraud, italian sounding and allow italian companies to defend the numerous high quality productions that are made in Italy. Even non-fungiable tokens could also play a crucial role that allows a creation of unique tokens to digial assets like images, videos and music. It represents a programmable ownership of certificates for digital products allowing creators and companies to sell their digital products while maintaining complete control over the rights. Now, blockchain technology plays in important roles in wine industry [7], food industry [8] etc. The success of of this technology primarily depends upon transparency, reliability and immuatability. </p> <p>The worldwide supply chain for everyday products involves a lot of movement making it very complicated. Unlike the financial system, there\u2019s no central authority watching over the supply chain. Normally, companies need to keep their own records of the products they send and receive. This can cause problems even with technology. Big companies with many locations and products find it hard to keep track of what they have. They also have to deal with things like products getting lost or wasted, fake products and not knowing everything about their supply chains. These problems can lead to breaking trading rules and harming a company\u2019s reputation. To make things better companies are looking for ways to see where their products are where they come from and to check if they\u2019re real. Using blockchain in a supply chain means all the parties can share the same information. Products can be put on the blockchain as tokens and their movements are added as transactions which everyone agrees on before it becomes a permanent record. Using an unchangeable record of products and transactions in a supply chain has many advantages. First, it helps to follow products in real-time. When combined with tools like location-tracking devices, keeping an eye on products becomes easier. Second, it proves where products come from and if they\u2019re real making customers trust the supply chain more. For instance, products claiming to be made from sustainable sources can prove it to customers. It also reduces fraud and fake products. Lastly, the clear and open data in blockchain can make financial operations in the supply chain smoother. Before it was complicated to track money between companies, banks and creditors. With everyone agreeing on product availability, location and delivery dates, it\u2019s easier to calculate risks and agree on payments. This could also lead to more automated transactions using smart contracts. Companies can choose different types of blockchains for their supply chains. They don\u2019t always have to use public ones where everyone can see the information. They can use private blockchains that only certain people can access. These are often liked by big businesses because they can control who sees the information. This can help with following rules about money laundering and other regulations. On the other hand, as discussed public blockchains let anyone take part but everyone can see what\u2019s happening.</p>"},{"location":"#2-methodology","title":"2.

What is Web3 and it's role in \"Made in Italy\" ?","text":"<p>Web1, spanning 1990-2004, offered static online content, making users mere consumers. Web2, the current state, introduced interaction and content upload, with Facebook and YouTube as examples. However, this interactivity raised concerns like privacy and polarization. Web3 aims to shift control to users through blockchain-based networks, maintaining Web2 features. Ad-driven models led to data exploitation, while curated feeds fueled polarization and mental health issues. In contrast, decentralized apps (dapps) in Web3 involve user-driven decisions through token-based governance, addressing Web2's problems. Web3, the emerging paradigm, holds the potential to rectify these issues by shifting control from corporations to users, while retaining the interactive features of Web2. This new model, often described as \"read/write/own,\" utilizes blockchain-based networks and cryptocurrency tokens for user governance. Decisions within these networks are made collectively by token holders, fostering transparency and decentralization. By decentralizing decision-making and eliminating the influence of a single entity, Web3 aims to mitigate problems like biased content curation and data harvesting. This could result in a more equitable and user-centric online environment, potentially addressing the challenges that emerged in the Web2 era [47].</p> <p>The expanding global economy continually highlights the significance of supply chain management and logistics, particularly due to shipping delays at major ports and limited product availability. When integrated into these processes, Web3 brings numerous advantages such as decentralized data control, streamlined supply chain component management, and aggregation. Web3 has revolutionized supply chain management and logistics by offering a decentralized and secure data-sharing infrastructure through blockchain technology. This approach enhances transparency, reduces costs, and mitigates risks across the supply chain. Integrating web3 dosen't mean only blockchain but a blend of technologies like AI, smart contracts, IOT and distributed ledgers. This empowers seamless coordination among supply chain participants, ensuring compliance, traceability, and efficient data management which gives benefits like improved visibility &amp; transparency, reduced administrative burden, proper monitoring of entire product journey etc. [48].</p> <ul> <li>How is web3 beneficial for \"Made in Italy\" [48]?</li> </ul> <p>-&gt; Traceability:- Web3 enhances traceability and operational efficiency in Italy's supply chain and logistics. By securely mapping the entire process, Italian products gain transparency. Web3's blockchain empowers Italian enterprises to share verified sourcing and transaction details with consumers.</p> <p>-&gt; Transparency:- Web3 fosters trust and security in the Italian supply chain. Unique hash values ensure authenticity, allowing open access. Blockchain registration and real-time validation maintain transparency throughout the \"Made in Italy\" journey.</p> <p>-&gt; Tradability:- Web3's tradability feature transforms the Italian supply chain. Tokenizing assets redefines market dynamics, granting legitimate digital ownership. This innovation enhances the allure of Italian goods on the global stage.</p> <p>-&gt; Web3 also introduces the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to verify and track product authenticity. NFTs establish distinct digital identities for each item, ensuring traceability across the supply chain. This combats counterfeit products, fostering consumer-brand trust [49].</p> <p>-&gt; Cryptography &amp; Smart contracts:- In Web3 employs advanced techniques to securely manage data and transactions in networks, ledgers, and smart contracts. Access and modification of supply chain information are restricted to authorized parties, ensuring data integrity within decentralized systems. Smart contracts automate critical supply chain functions, such as payments, shipping notifications, inspections, and trades, adhering to predefined rules. These contracts minimize paperwork, enhance predictability, and reduce the potential for errors or fraudulent activities among trading partners [50].</p> <p>-&gt; Smart contracts also streamline intricate negotiations, agreements, transfers, payments, and other interactions among trading partners, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This automation enhances predictability, reduces disputes, and enables seamless global exchanges. The system's scalability ensures it can accommodate extensive supplier, shipper, carrier, and buyer networks, handling substantial transaction volumes [50].</p> <p>Web3 benefits the \"Made in Italy\" brand by enhancing transparency, traceability, and authenticity across the supply chain. Utilizing blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it ensures product legitimacy and prevents counterfeits. Smart contracts automate processes like payments and shipping, reducing errors and paperwork. This technology-driven approach boosts consumer trust, minimizes disputes, and expands global market access. By integrating advanced cryptography and decentralized systems, Web3 safeguards supply chain data, offering efficiency and security for Italian products, while promoting Italy's rich heritage of craftsmanship and quality.</p>"},{"location":"#8-conclusion","title":"8. Conclusion","text":"<p>The world of blockchain technology is rapidly evolving and its potential impact on industries and economies is becoming increasingly evident. In this comprehensive thesis, we have explored various aspects of blockchain, its potential to benefit \"Made in Italy\" products, and its role in ensuring provenance, traceability and process of a product claimed to be \"made in Italy\" in supply chains. Through our exploration, we have seen how blockchain can be leveraged to enhance the \"Made in Italy\" brand, promoting local artisans and products to a global audience. By utilizing blockchain in supply chains, such as the example of coffee, we can guarantee the provenance of products, thereby assuring consumers of their authenticity and quality (ofcourse by considering other challanges). Several blockchain technologies and platforms, including Hyperledger Fabric, EBSI, Corda, and NFTs, offer unique features that can be harnessed to address specific challenges in various industries. Each of these technologies comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and businesses must carefully assess their requirements before adopting any particular solution. In particular, Hyperledger Fabric has emerged as a suitable option for certain use cases, offering robust privacy and permission features, making it an attractive choice for enterprises and consortium-based networks. Meanwhile, initiatives like Food Trust by IBM and Walmart &amp; other exisiting cases where enterprises are already using blockchain to gurantee provenance &amp; it shows the power of blockchain to prevent against counterfeiting attacks and italian sounding.  However, it\u2019s important to note that the choice of blockchain ultimately depends on specific use cases, requirements, and various other factors. We\u2019ve observed how initiatives like IBM\u2019s Food Trust and TrackIT project, FederItaly along with many Italian companies and other luxury brands are already using blockchain to ensure the authenticity and traceability of products highlighting the power of blockchain in combating counterfeiting and protecting their brands and products labeled as \"Made in Italy.\" Another famous examples in shipping are Maersk, a big shipping company made a new system with IBM called TradeLens. It uses blockchain to help them and their partners share data quickly and documents in real-time which makes dealing with shipping papers faster and cheaper. Then there\u2019s ShipChain back of Ethereum blockchain technology, another system that uses blockchain. It helps people who send things, people who carry them, and people</p> <p>Blockchain technology has already demonstrated its potential to revolutionize numerous industries and countries by delivering enhanced efficiency, trust, and authenticity.  However, its widespread adoption requires continued collaboration, research, and overcoming technical and regulatory challenges. With the right vision and strategic implementation, Italy can be at the forefront of blockchain adoption and innovation, solidifying its position as a global leader in quality craftsmanship and products proudly labeled \"Made in Italy.\" </p>"},{"location":"#references","title":"References","text":"<p>[1] What is made in Italy?</p> <p>[2] Blockchain applied to made in Italy</p> <p>[3] An IoT Blockchain-Based Framework for Certifying Extra Virgin Olive Oil Supply Chain.In: Proceedings of the 5th IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing 2019: Washington, United States</p> <p>[4] Blockchain for the metaverse: A Review</p> <p>[5] Blockchain :- Michael Nofer, Peter Gomber, Oliver Hinz &amp; Dirk Schiereck</p> <p>[6] Ford Blockchain</p> <p>[7] Blockchain-Based Wine Supply Chain for the Industry Advancement</p> <p>[8] Blockchain Technology in the Food Industry: A Review of Potentials, Challenges and Future Research Directions</p> <p>[9] How-to conduct a systematic literature review: A quick guide for computer science research</p> <p>[10] Made in Italy, a blockchain project to combat counterfeiting on international markets.</p> <p>[11] TRADE IN COUNTERFEIT GOODS AND THE ITALIAN ECONOMY</p> <p>[12] \u201cIl MIO World\u201d the innovative anti-counterfeiting solution that combines Blockchain and NFC.</p> <p>[13] PROTECTING MADE IN ITALY WITH BLOCKCHAIN(textile)</p> <p>[14] It\u2019s real, trust me!
