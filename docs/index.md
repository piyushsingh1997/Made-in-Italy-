# **Proposals Made in Italy**

## Abstract

Blockchain is a decentralized distributed data structure used to record transactions that are aggregated in blocks across many systems, it has revolutionized the way societies interacts and trades. Crypotocurrencies like bitcoin, etherium etc. run on the technology called blockchain. This paper reviews the use of blockchain in several different fields espically to support made in Italy to certify the provenance and process of a product claimed to be Made in Italy.  (**further points would be added in the abstract section in future**).


## 1. Introduction

When we say *Made in Italy* it is a merchandise mark that indicates that a product is all planned, manufactured and packed in Italy, espically concerning the design, fashion, food, wine, manufacturing, craftsmanship and engineering industries. It is well known and highly regarded label that signifies quality, crafstmanship. It is worth noticing that counterfeit products and unauthorized use of the *"Made in Italy"* mark are unfortunately common. There are those who see the blockchain as the solution to protect the real made in Italy from clones and immitations for sale. As data that is stored on the blockchains are immutable and difficult to delete. Reliability of the data collected on the blockchain makes it's interesting for tracability. For example, over 300 products with quality certifications (DOP, IGP, SGT), more than 500 DOC, DOCG, IGT wines, for a value added in 2021 of 64 billion euros and export value of 50 billion euros; values ​​that, however, pale in comparison to the market value of Italian Sounding, or the improper use of names, logos, and images that emulate Made in Italy, but have nothing Italian about them, a market that, according to Coldiretti and Filiera Italia estimates, is worth more than 100 billion euros [[1]](https://affidaty.io/blog/en/2023/03/blockchain-made-in-italy-2/). 

## 1.1 What is Blockchain ? 
**Blockchain** plays an important role and it can be defined as "an immutable ledger for recording transactions, maintained within a distributed network of mutually untrusted blocks. A blockchain is a list of ordered blocks, where each block stores a variable size list of transactions" [[2]](http://docenti.ing.unipi.it/p.perazzo/research/2019%20-%20BRUSCHETTA_%20An%20IoT%20Blockchain-Based%20Framework%20for%20Certifying%20Extra%20Virgin%20Olive%20Oil%20Supply%20Chain.pdf).

In this regard, blockchain technology plays an important role to certify the provenance and products that claims to be "Made in Italy". Blockchain plays an important role in combating food fraud, italian sounding and allow italian companies to defend the numerous high quality productions that are made in Italy. Even non-fungiable tokens could also play a crucial role that allows a creation of unique tokens to digial assets like images, videos and music. It represents a programmable ownership of certificates for digital products allowing creators and companies to sell their digital products while maintaining complete control over the rights. Now, blockchain technology plays in important roles in wine industry [[3]](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/23/13070), food industry [[4]](https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6290/4/4/27) etc. The success of of this technology primarily depends upon transparency, reliability and immuatability. 

In this paper, we are on the best two industries fashion and wine. How blockchain can help "made in Italy", what technologies are actually the most suitable and will help in certify the provinance of the products that are made in Italy. The paper is structured is as follows section 2 is the research methodology section 3-5 is is implementation of these steps in the methodology and in section 6 the conclusion is presented.


## 2. *Methodology*

Our Reaserch methodology is characterized by the following steps [[5]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920306181):- 

1. Data collection
2. Data selection (Inclusion and exclusion criteria, Digital libraries etc.)
3. Report, analysis, discussions, comparisons and conclusions. 

In the first step, we're discussing about collection data from various sources like scientific papers, blogs, surveys, online database, publicly available data, statistical information. Scientific papers are obtained based on certain keywords, citations, document type etc. 

In the second step, that is data selection we are interested describing our selection criteria like what kind of papers or blogs will be included and excluded based on certain criteria (like. period, language of the paper etc.). 

In the third step, we are selected papers are reviewed and then the pros and cons of different blockchains technologies, how it will help "Made in Italy", problems, future developments and conclusions.
