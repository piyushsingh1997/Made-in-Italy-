1. This website I've hosted on Github just to share information in convenient way(with one click) and eveything it is written in markdown(MKDOCS).
2. I have tried my best to include citations for each paragraph or sentence, referencing the papers, blogs, or articles I've read online as told by you.
3.  Sentences or paragraphs where you don't find citations or references they represent the conclusions I have personally drawn from the information I've read online.
4. Please let me know the feedbacks, changes or if something is wrong. If you can give me appointment for 15 minutes, it would be great to discuss it in person as I get much more clearity in person.

Thanks
